# MinPaste
A lightweight minimal text-hosting tool for self-hosting

## About
MinPaste is a text-hosting tool written in PHP and HTML5. It works out-of-the-box and is easy to use. I made it in 2h, so there may be bugs.

## Installation
Just download the latest release and upload it to your webserver. Done!

If you want to delete a paste, you can delete the .txt file in the "pastes" folder.

## License
You are allowed to:
 - Host this software on your own server!
 - Make changes to the software!

You are not allowed to:
 - Use the software commercially!
 - Upload this software (as yours and not as yours) in any form except as a website on a webserver!


# Don't use this shit for real purposes, it's vulnerable as fuck
For example:
 - XSS
 - CSRF
 - LFI
 - RCE (?; depends on PHP somehow)
